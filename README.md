project for Programming 2B - a web application that helps lecturers submit monthly claims and allows coordinators to review them.
I built it using ASP.NET Core MVC with a focus on making the claim process easier for everyone involved.
The system lets lecturers fill out a simple form that automatically calculates their total payment, while coordinators get a clean dashboard to approve or reject claims.
There's also an HR section for viewing statistics and generating reports.
It's not perfect, but it shows what I've learned about web development, databases, and creating user-friendly applications. Feel free to check out the code and see how it works!
